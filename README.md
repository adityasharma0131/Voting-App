# Online Voting System

This Online Voting System is designed and developed using React. We utilize the browser's localStorage to store information about Users, Admins, Candidates, and Vote Counts.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register, login, and cast their votes.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins have access to manage candidates, view voting statistics, and more.
- **Candidate Management**: Admins can add, edit, or remove candidates from the system.
- **Vote Counting**: The system accurately counts and stores votes using localStorage.
- **Security**: The system ensures secure authentication and authorization for both users and admins.
